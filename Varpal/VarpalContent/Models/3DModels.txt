All *.fbx Objects are made with Daz3D, exported as *.fbx, each model
has a folder containing images it uses as textures, you add
both the fbx file and the image directory to the models folder, 
then click the foler that contains the images and click remove from project
so all we see if the model file, but the directory actually contains
more images for it.
